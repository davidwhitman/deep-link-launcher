# Deep Link Launcher

This is a small but useful Android app to launch deep links. 

[download nightly](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/davidwhitman/deep-link-launcher/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk?filter=successful
)

A deep link is a url that can take you to a specific page within a mobile app; for example, directly to somebody's Facebook profile page. 

[See: What is deep linking?](https://branch.io/what-is-deep-linking/)
